# Compiler
This is an sample compiler for simple calculations . 


Look i know iam not a big deal (atleast for now) and i know this compiler only does basic mathematical operations. 
but iam trying my best to build something great 
for now (jan 2022) this is the best i got (but started the project in october 2021)
ok if you are reading this, than chances are that you are my friend or my sister 
so go on try forking this repository and try to play with it 

ANOTHER NOTE :
           Keep in mind that this compiler which i have built does not work on BODMAS or PEMDAS methods of mathematical instructions .
           It has it's seperate preferential order of mathematical operations. 
           If this code doesn't work on your IDE than try running this code in codeblockcs .
           As i have written this in codeblocks IDE i don't have more time trying on every single IDE that is present 


For now I have written this compiler in c language not because i know c very well but c++ is very complex for me to write this compiler
(trust me you will also find it a little intimidating at times)
