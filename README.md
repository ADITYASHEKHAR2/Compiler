# Compiler
This is an sample compiler for simple calculations don't laugh at this 


Look i know iam not a big deal (atleast for now) and i know this compiler only does basic mathematical operations. 
but iam trying my best to build something great 
for now (jan 2022) this is the best i got 
ok if you are reading this, than chances are that you are my friend or my sister 
so go on try forking this repository and try to play with it 

ANOTHER NOTE :
           Keep in mind that this compiler which i have built does not work on BODMAS or PEMDAS methods of mathematical instructions 
           it has it's seperate preferential order of mathematical operations
